Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided an NLQ: "Show me the top 5 sales from last month." My task is to extract only the SQL-relevant elements explicitly mentioned here.

First, I'll identify the intent. The phrase "show me" clearly indicates a SELECT intent in SQL. So, that's one key element down.

Next, looking at the data required: "top 5 sales". This translates to using the LIMIT keyword in SQL with the value 5. That's straightforward and directly mentioned.

Now, considering the tables or views involved, there's no mention of any specific table name like "Sales" or a view alias. So, I won't include anything here since it's not provided.

For columns, the query refers to "sales", which typically maps to the column name "Sales". Therefore, I'll add that as well.

There are no additional clauses mentioned such as JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, or any filters beyond what's implied by LIMIT. Since nothing else is specified, these can be omitted.

Aggregations aren't explicitly stated here; it just asks for the top sales without mentioning functions like SUM or COUNT. So, aggregations won't be included either.

I should also check if there are any subqueries, set operations, negations, distinct keywords, or clarifications mentioned. There's nothing of that sort in this query.

Lastly, I need to ensure that I'm not including any default values like OFFSET=0 because they're not explicitly stated here.

Putting it all together, the JSON should include the intent as SELECT, the limit value 5, and the column Sales from an implied table. All other fields are either not mentioned or can be safely omitted.

```json
{
  "intent": "SELECT",
  "limit": 5,
  "columns": ["Sales"]
}
```

This is your final answer! I've done my best to ensure it's correct and complete based on the user's query.

```json
{
  "intent": "SELECT",
  "limit": 5,
  "columns": ["Sales"]
}
```

This JSON represents a SQL query that selects the top 5 sales entries. The `SELECT` keyword specifies the column to retrieve, `LIMIT 5` restricts the result to the top 5 rows, and `Columns: ["Sales"]` indicates which column to display.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "intent": "SELECT",
  "limit": 5,
  "columns": ["Sales"]
}
```
